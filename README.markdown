ObjectConpherter: Converting PHP Objects Into Array Representations Since 2011
==============================================================================

Mission Statement
-----------------

ObjectConpherter takes your business objects and converts them into arrays while
keeping there hierarchial structure. The project was born because [we](http://jarlssen.de)
needed a system to provide array representations of business objects for a JSON API.


Current Use Cases
-----------------
-   Property mapping support for the concrete class, superclass(es), interfaces
-   Filter infrastructure to allow implementing conversions for specific types
    (e.g. formatting date specifically), renaming of properties (if you use an
    underscore with protected properties, you might not want to show that in
    your API)
-   Configuration readers to support defining export properties as Annotations
    and in XML. For the sake of speed there might be a configuration dumper
    component to convert annotations into plain PHP

Warning
-------
This software is a few seconds old so it canâ€™t do anything right now
